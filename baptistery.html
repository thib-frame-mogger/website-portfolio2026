    <p class="project-detail-text">
        Class project carried out from February 2025 to April 2025.
        <br><br> The design of the baptistery was conceived by the Parisian architectural firm Duthilleul for the
        Saint-Ambroise Church in the 11th arrondissement.
        <br><br> My classmates and I had to find a practical way to produce, assemble, and deliver a functional,
        high-quality baptistery while respecting the original design and the constraints of the site.
        <br><br> We chose to use a combination of rolled, bent, and bolted parts for the body, while using single formed
        pieces made through dinanderie where watertightness was required. We spent an extraordinary amount of time
        hammering the receptacle, sometimes with four to six hands. It was a marvelous opportunity to create a highly
        detailed and enduring piece.
