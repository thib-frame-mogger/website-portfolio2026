        Laying Dimes - Making Dollars
    </h1>

    <p class="project-detail-text">
        Fanzine -2024
        <br><br>Not supposed to be an accurate representation of the american welding industry in general, but rather
        the
        imagery I made of it in my mind. This overly caricaturization of the Americana/West Texas type of rig
        welding/pipeliner lifestyle was overly inspred by the consumption of instagram reels, songs and movies.

        <br><br> "Laying Dimes" refers to the way the welder lays down a bead of weld, which is often described as
        looking
        like a row of dimes. "Making Dollars" refers to the stacking up of those dimes, and the living it allows. The
        zine is a tongue-in-cheek take on the trade-off from this lifestyle (money against health), and the (often
        toxic) sub-culture that surrounds it.


        <br><br>I do not own the rights to the images used in this zine, and I do not intend to make any
        money
        off
        of it. It is a personal project that I made for fun and to practice my design skills.
